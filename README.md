# BI-LSTM Classification
## Main goal:
Develop an ML model that classifies each coordinate group into "line" or "arc"

## Topic:
AI-based classification of geometric trajectory segments (arc vs line) from sequential 2D coordinates

## Tasks:
- Visualization and explanation of Artificial Intelligence decision-making process​
- Initial data collection and pre-processing​
- Prototyping and rapid development of Artificial Intelligence systems​
- Artificial intelligence algorithm implementation and model training​
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization​
- Development and execution of a comprehensive testing plan for the Artificial Intelligence prototype​
- Security and privacy assessment of Artificial Intelligence systems​
Deployment and scalability of Artificial Intelligence systems​

## Contribution:
